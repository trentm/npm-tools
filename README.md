Trent's own tools for working with npm.
(Note: This isn't related to the defunct https://github.com/webcoding/npm-tools
which has the 'npm-tools' package name on npm.)

Currently I don't have any plans to have generally useful tools here.
If something useful comes out of this, then I'll document it here.



# TODO

- `npm-ws-oneach` (see eon/scripts/oneach.sh for inspiration). Not sure if want
  as JS code or bash. If JS, then could share logic with npm-ws-ls, could have
  filtering options, etc. Not sure if worth it.
