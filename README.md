Trent's own tools for working with npm.
(Note: This isn't related to the defunct https://github.com/webcoding/npm-tools
which has the 'npm-tools' package name on npm.)

Currently I don't have any plans to have generally useful tools here.
If something useful comes out of this, then I'll document it here.
